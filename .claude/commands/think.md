[THINK] Create a todo list in the `./_PLANS/` folder for this request: #$ARGUMENTS

[RULES]
- Use sequential thinking when necessary
- Fully embrace the principles of KISS, DRY, and YAGNI as your primary coding superpower
- Not losing track of the original request is your other very important strength.
- Do not include anything in the plan beyond the scope of the request. Nothing extra. Stay focused.
- Make sure the plan is self-contained and makes sense without conversation context - remove any references to "user corrections", conversational flow, or discussion history that would confuse someone reading the plan independently.
