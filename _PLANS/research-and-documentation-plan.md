# Research and Documentation Plan for Simplified Streaming Node

## Overview
Comprehensive research plan to understand correct implementation patterns before proceeding with the simplified Claude Code streaming node. This plan uses n8n-mcp and context7 tools to gather proper documentation and best practices.

## Research Objectives
- Understand n8n node development best practices for streaming and dual outputs
- Learn Claude Code SDK proper patterns for conversation persistence and streaming
- Document correct implementation approaches before coding
- Create implementation guide based on research findings

## Research Tasks

### 1. n8n Node Streaming Architecture Research
- [ ] Read n8n docs and add to report: n8n node streaming patterns and dual output implementation
- [ ] Read n8n docs and add to report: proper node properties structure and parameter handling  
- [ ] Read n8n docs and add to report: execute function patterns and data flow best practices
- [ ] Read n8n docs and add to report: dual output implementation and streaming data formats
- [ ] Read n8n docs and add to report: proper error handling patterns with NodeOperationError

### 2. Claude Code SDK Deep Dive
- [ ] Read Claude Code SDK docs and add to report: conversation persistence, streaming APIs, and query options
- [ ] Read Claude Code SDK docs and add to report: message types, content parsing, and streaming patterns

### 3. Data Flow and Persistence Patterns
- [ ] Read n8n docs and add to report: workflow static data vs SDK persistence patterns
- [ ] Read docs and add to report: structured message formats for real-time streaming

### 4. Documentation and Implementation
- [ ] Create comprehensive report with correct implementation patterns for simplified streaming node
- [ ] Implement simplified node based on research findings and report recommendations
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md to reflect simplified architecture based on research
- [ ] Update workflow templates for simplified usage based on research

## Research Tools to Use
- **n8n-mcp**: For n8n node development patterns, streaming, outputs, execution flows
- **context7**: For Claude Code SDK documentation, APIs, streaming patterns

## Deliverables
1. **Research Report**: Comprehensive documentation of proper implementation patterns
2. **Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step approach based on research findings
3. **Simplified Node**: Correctly implemented streaming node following best practices
4. **Updated Documentation**: CLAUDE.md and workflow templates reflecting new architecture

## Success Criteria
- Deep understanding of n8n streaming node patterns before implementation
- Proper Claude Code SDK usage patterns documented
- Implementation follows established best practices rather than custom approaches
- Real-time message streaming with structured block format
- Single conversation thread leveraging SDK's built-in persistence
